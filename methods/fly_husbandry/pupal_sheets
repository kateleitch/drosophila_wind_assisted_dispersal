Pupal sheet manufacture
***********************
Materials:
3M CG6000 overhead transparencies (____ mm thick, polyester with an unknown proprietary coating)
cutting file:    /home/kate/Documents/coyote_lake_methods/husbandry/pupal_sheet_laser_cutter_file.svg
laser cutter

Procedure
to cut out sheets, use 80% speed and 9% power
after cutting, rinse sheets in warm soapy water to remove any haze (smells noxious, possibly toxic to fly larvae)
cutting out pupal sheets is more time consuming than the labor required for their reuse

Pupal sheet reuse
*****************
Be sure to remove pupal sheets from release chambers before driving to the release site.
Immediately after removing sheets from chamber, toss into tupperware of hot soapy water. Soak.
Agitate and soak, then sheets can be wiped clean.
Dip in ethanol
String up a "clothesline" and hang pupal sheets to dry. If sheets stick together they won't dry properly


Quantifying pupae on sheets
***************************
Using Getac field laptop (password rotcam) and transillumination setup, image a random subset of
pupal sheets before transferring to release chamber. These images can then be run through my
quantal analysis scripts to estimate the average number of pupae per sheet, which can then be used
to estimate the total number of pupae transferred to the release chamber.

At the moment the rate of failure-to-eclose is not being monitored.
Also the number of flies that fail to leave the release chamber is not being monitored.

Transillumination and imaging setup
Camera: Basler acA640, powered with PoE (using one of those PHIHONG PoE boxes)
Lens:
Lightbox: Advanced Illumination backlight system, I believe the BL0808 (confirm this)
Image acquisition: Aravis


    frame rate 10 hz
    exposure 500 microseconds
    gain 100 dB
    pixel format: mono8
    region position: 19,0 pixels
    binning 1,1 pixels
    region size 640, 480 pixels

Procedure:
log in to Getac laptop (password rotcam)
power camera with PoE (power over ethernet) and connect to rotcam via the ethernet port (I've configured it to DHCP)
launch Aravis Viewer 
	via gui navigate Applications>Multimedia>Aravis

	OR

	$ cd src/aravis-0.3.7/viewer/
	$ arv-viewer

In list of available channels select the BasleracA640 etcetera
Set pixel format, region position, binning, region size to parameters listed above:

$cd src/aravis-0.3.7/src
$arv-tool-0.4 control Width=640 Height=480  #this command may need to be run twice, not sure why; check filename of a saved image afterward to ensure it reads 640-480 and make sure image has actual content

Power lightbox - be mindful of lightbox overheating; I've rigged up this system maybe haphazardly
The "play" gui button should prompt a live image view from the Basler camera
Set frame rate, exposure, and gain to those parameters listed above
At this point a live image of the lightbox should be shown; position pupal sheet in field of view and acquire image
Save all images in /home/michael/Pictures/Aravis/pupal_sheet_imaging/[today's date]_group_[which release chamber]

Transfer images from field laptop to my desktop (Ptarmigan) for analysis:
    Connect via ethernet cable the DHCP-configured ports of getac and my desktop
    from getac command line:
        $ cd /home/michael/Pictures/Aravis/pupal_sheet_imaging
        $ scp -r ./[subfolder with today's images] kate@[ptarmigan IP address, should be 192.168.5.1]:/home/kate/Documents/fly_rearing_records/[subfolder name]
