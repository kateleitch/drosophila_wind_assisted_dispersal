DAY OF FLY RELEASE: ITINERARY
-----Day-of packing-----
Make sure pupal sheets have been removed from chambers, and replaced with soft cloth (can do this the night before)
Keep flies out of direct sunlight with reflective tarps
Make sure bait is loaded into one of the cars!


-----Driving-----
Meet at lab at 5 am, pack cars (put release-site items and upcams in Michael's car?)
Leave at 5:30 am
Follow directions to start of Coyote Lake Road [34.934076, -116.713470]:
	1. drive east on the 210 until the junction with 15, exit 64A. Take 15 North, toward Barstow
	2. keep driving north over Cajon pass, through San Bernardino Forest
	3. around Barstow, take care to stay on 15. Do not take 40.
	4. in Yermo, take exit 198 for Minneola Road.
	5. turn right (south) on Minneola Road.
	6. take a left at first stop sign, on Yermo road. At this point you'll be driving east, parallel with 15 
	7. you'll see, to your left, a small overpass that will allow you to drive north back over the 15. This is Coyote Lake Road. At this intersection you'll see a sign for St. Antony's Monastery. 
	8. turn left onto Coyote lake road
	9. after crossing over the 15, the road will curve sharply toward the east. About fifty meters later, turn left onto the wide dirt road.
	10. this is our meeting site. [34.934076, -116.713470]
Drive north, passing under the first powerline (which runs NE) until approximately [34.976482, -116.715132], where the road will start turning NW
Drive northwest until [35.033871, -116.752033], which is the edge of the lakebed
Drive to release site at [35.05883, -116.74556]
Arrive at release site a little before 8:30 am


-----Setting up for first fly release -----
1) Upward-facing camera layout
	keep cars away from release site, and don't set up the anemometer tripod just yet... they'll get in the way
	drive a plastic stake into the site of the fly release
	put acrylic compass (10 divisions or 8 divisions) over this stake, oriented wrt north
	use yellow cord (on spool, marked with 10, 20 meter points) to place stakes or flags at intended upcam sites

2) Metone anemometer -- initial setup
	set up tripod, mount crossbar assembly and sensors
	before mounting the vane on the direction sensor, put level/compass collar on the sensor. Orient notch to magnetic south!!
	mount vane and spinning cups on their respective sensors (direction, speed)
	connect cables to teensy, but not yet to the battery or the laptop; we'll wait until we're done setting up the upward-facing cameras

3) Temp/humidity sensor
	plug it in to its battery, set up under the anemometer.

4) Upward-facing camera deployment
	to save battery on laptop, ensure wifi and bluetooth are disabled
	kate's typical naming convention has been to start naming at the northern camera, and proceed clockwise from there
	orient each camera so its top-of-frame is oriented north
	start video acquisition; see detailed instructions in section below
	provide camera with 15-20 seconds of checkerboard calibration
	for your peace of mind later, you might want to flash a compass in the camera FOV so you can later confirm that you had oriented it correctly

5) Trap and trapcam deployment
	to save battery on laptop, ensure wifi and bluetooth are disabled
	set up aluminum tripods (stakes really not needed) so that its top crossbeam is oriented N-S
	after mixing bait, pour 500 mL into trap bucket
	situate banana island
	secure trap-top
	mount trapcam on aluminum crossbeam such that top-of-frame is oriented to the N
	start web-cam interface; see detailed instructions in section below
	ensure camera is focused on trap-top; take a still image via web-cam interface and zoom in on it. Bias grain of traptop should be clearly visible. Adjust lens with white collars if needed
	double-check that timestamps are reflecting the correct time; if not, could reset pi time (see troubleshooting, below) and/or flash digital watch in frame (synchronized to laptops) 

6) Metone anemometer -- data acquisition
	this can happen at any point, once one of the laptops is free
	plug anemometer into its battery (separate leads for speed, direction, and heater)
	connect teensy to the laptop 
	start logging via laptop; see data acquisition details below
	

7) First fly release 
	take one of the two fly chambers out of the car, and set up at release site
	two people drive both cars ~1.2 km downwind to a mutually-agreed-upon site; leave the third person to release flies
	release-person should have:
		- a full liter of water
		- hat/sunscreen on
		- notepad and pen
		- cell phone
		- walkie-talkie
		- satellite messenger
	remove plastic lid (note time)
	decide on release timing based on the wind:
		has anemometer been recording for at least ten minutes?
		has average windspeed been acceptably low (below 5mph/2.2mps is great, below 10mph/4.5mps is acceptable) for a few minutes?
		release flies by entirely removing mesh top and lying down to get out of their way, thumping the bucket to promote departure
		after 5 minutes of the chamber being open, re-close the chamber and seal up with the stench-barrier
	remove any hitchhiking flies from clothing, and walk to cars 
	when walking past ring of upcams, keep as much distance from them as possible

8) Eat lunch, make sure second batch of flies is staying shaded

9) First round of collection from traps
	one hour after the release, drive around 1-km ring to collect flies. Leave cameras undisturbed
	before opening trap, spray mesh with EtOH to knock all flies into bait
	pour bait and flies through mesh funnel (supported by plastic funnel) into 1-gallon labeled waste containers
	make sure all flies are rinsed off banana island and inside of trap to join their brethren in the mesh funnel
	quickly close up mesh funnel and put in labeled jar (A1, B1, C1, etc)
	re-bait trap (500 mL)
	re-set trap by affixing trap-top again
	
-----Setting up for second fly release -----
10) take one car with flies back to release site
11) repeat release as before
12) wait a half hour, then start shutting down (see data acquisition instructions) and packing upcams
13) wait one hour before collecting from 1-km traps, this time shutting down trapcams (see data acquisition instructions) and repacking everything
14) return to release site to pack anemometer and temp/humidity logger, as well as the spent release buckets
15) drive back to SW corner of lakebed [35.033871, -116.752033]
16) drive back home!


DATA ACQUISITION STUFF
- acquiring data from the orange mini-vanes (current plan is to have five pis at 1-km acquiring wind-direction data in addition to timelapse data of the trap-top):
	1. know that ONLY SOME of the raspberry pis have the em3242_wind_vane software installed; these currently are marked on their acrylic housing. As of 25 Jan 2019, 5 pis are configured to record 	from mini-vane
	2. before or after sshing into pi, plug mini-vane's teensy into one of the USB ports of the pi
	3. as of April 2019, all 5 raspberry pis (marked as such) will automatically launch the wind_vane_server upon booting; just navigate a browser window to [rpi.ip.address]:5000
	4. if for some reason you need manual booting of the wind_vane_server:
		$ cd ~/src/em3242_wind_vane/software/javascript/wind_vane_server
		$ node server.js
			> should print info such as:
				* log directory: /home/pi/wind_vane_data
				* listening on port: 5000
		at this point navigate a browser window to same address as described above [rpi.ip.address]:5000

- acquiring timelapse data from the traps
	1. I configured both field laptops' ethernet ports as DHCP servers, so either one can be used for this task
	2. While the trap/tripod are being set up, power the pi via usb (from portable battery) and connect it to laptop via ethernet cable
	3. All raspberry pis should be assigned the SAME ip address from either laptop: 192.168.93.10
	4. $ ssh pi@192.168.93.10
	5. All raspberry pis should have been given ssh keys from both laptops, so a password isn't required; but if I missed any of them, all pis' passwords are: raspberry
	6. direct internet browswer to 192.168.93.10 ---------> ---> (AND BE SURE TO REFRESH PAGE) <---- <------------
	7. from here, web-cam GUI is accesssible:
		a. ensure timelapse parameters are correct (e.g. 2 second interval)
		b. take a still-photo of the trap top and zoom in on it to determine if camera is well-focused (should easily see bias grain of trap fabric)
		c. timelapse start
	8. taking care not to dislodge the pi's power cable, unplug ethernet connection --
	[------------------------------Release flies, record data---------------------------------------------]
	9. Powering off:
		a. all trapcams have a power-down button installed. you can depress it for 3 seconds, and it will enter power-off sequence
		b. for any spare trapcams that do not have a power-down button, connect camera to laptop
			EITHER
			$ ssh pi@192.168.93.10
			$ sudo shutdown now
			
			OR
			navigate web browser to 192.168.93.10
			click "stop video"
			at bottom of page, click system > power off
		c. unplug from battery

- acquiring data from the MetOne anemometer (generally placed at the release site)
	1. both field laptops are equipped with Will's MetOne logging software, so either one can be used for this task
	2. both MetOne sensors (speed and direction) are powered by the same portable battery, with split cable. Wind direction's heater should also be powered by this cable; I've found this current draw 		prevents automatic shutoff of the batter
	3. both MetOne sensor cables terminate in a BNC connection; connect these to the teensy
	4. connect teensy to laptop via USB; this supplies power for teensy as well as serving data transmission
	5. logging
		to launch logging via Python GUI:
		cd ~/src/m1_wind_sensor/software/python/m1_wind_sensor/m1_wind_sensor
		workon anemometer
		m1_logger -w [width of display window in seconds]

		ALTERNATELY
		to launch logging via web server:
		cd ~/src/m1_wind_sensor/software/javascript/m1_wind_sensor_server
		node server.js
		http://localhost:5000/

		IN EITHER CASE
		data saved to ~/m1_wind_data in time-stamped .txt file

- acquiring data from the upward-facing cameras (Francesca sideslip project)
	1. I configured both field laptops' ethernet ports as DHCP servers, so either one can be used for this task
	2. Power the pi via usb (from portable battery) and connect it to laptop via ethernet cable
 	3. All raspberry pis should be assigned the SAME ip address from either laptop: 192.168.93.10
	4. [not really necessary for upcams] $ ssh pi@192.168.93.10
	5. All raspberry pis should have been given ssh keys from both laptops, so a password isn't required; but if I missed any of them, all pis' passwords are: raspberry
	6. direct internet browswer to 192.168.93.10 ---------> ---> (AND BE SURE TO REFRESH PAGE) <---- <------------
	7. from here, web-cam GUI is accesssible:
		a. video parameters will be whatever you had last specified in this GUI -- but you might wanna double-check
		c. video start
	8. taking care not to dislodge the pi's power cable, unplug ethernet connection --
	[------------------------------Release flies, record data---------------------------------------------]
	9. Powering off:
		a. almost all upcams do NOT have a power-down button installed. But one of them does; you can depress it for 3 seconds, and it will enter power-off sequence
		b. for other upcams, connect camera to laptop
			EITHER
			$ ssh pi@192.168.93.10
			$ sudo shutdown now
			
			OR
			navigate web browser to 192.168.93.10
			click "stop video"
			at bottom of page, click system > power off
		c. unplug from battery

- acquiring data from the temperature/humidity logger:
	1. plug it into its battery w USB cable
	2. it should start recording automatically and should also get a GPS fix
	3. to power off, unplug cable when blue LED is NOT on


COMMANDS THAT MAY PROVE USEFUL FOR TROUBLESHOOTING
-------issues with IP assignment:-------
	ifconfig
	dhcp-lease-list --lease /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases
	sudo ifdown --force enp0s31f6
	sudo ifup -a
	sudo service isc-dhcp-server restart

-------issues with acquiring data:-------

something like grep tty0 (look up command) to check if usb inputs (from anemometers) are recognized

/etc/rc.local is where raspimjpeg commands were populated by the web-cam interface

crontab -e will bring up any of the commands that we're telling the pis to execute upon rebooting

------- resetting pi clocks: -------
set time on pi from getac laptop with:
sudo date --set="$(ssh michael@192.168.93.2 'date')"

set time on pi from coyotelake laptop with:
sudo date --set="$(ssh kate@192.168.93.1 'date')"
