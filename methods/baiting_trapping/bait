Materials/quantities
********************
Plan to bait each trap with 500 mL ferment; bring at least 1L surplus into field to account for spillage
To make 3L of bait:

2.6L apple juice (Tree Top brand)
400g sugar				154 g/L
2.6 grams champagne yeast (EC-1118)	1g/L

To make 6L of bait:

5.2L apple juice 
800g sugar
5.2 g champagne yeast EC-1118

Fermentation
************
microwave apple juice enough to dissolve all sugar
sprinkle yeast into a small volume of *cool* apple juice to dissolve
once microwaved juice has cooled below 30C, add dissolved yeast and swirl
record pre-fermentation specific gravity; should be about 1.095
fermentation should occur in a PETE bottle with an airlock (for safety)
ferment at room temperature for 1.5-2.5 days
before leaving for the field, record post-fermentation specific gravity (pre- and post- values are used to calculate alcohol content)
    A simplified formula: (original sp.grav - final sp.grav)*131.25 = alcohol percentage by volume
