Chamber A studded 2019_04_05 in late afternoon
116 bottles, each with ~20 adults
yeast in bottles
moved to Hong lab incubator (8am -8pm light cycle, 25 C, _____ relative humidity) to mate and lay eggs for ~24 hours
flipped adults out on 2019_04_06 in late afternoon/early evening
inserted pupal sheets at same time
returned to Hong lab incubator (still 25 C)

on 12 April in late pm, transferred all pupal sheets to release chamber A. A good few percent of the flies were ALREADY eclosing; we wonder if the incubator was too warm. 
Tonight, I'm turning the incubator down to 22C

12 April ~5% eclosing
15 April ~100 eclosed. Looking great! Not the highest-density bucket I've ever achieved
18 April removed pupal sheets and provided clean fabric/paper towel. looking very dense and low mortality. Some pupae ( < 5% by visual estimate) not eclosed
declared 4-5 days old on 19 April

Chamber B studded 2019_04_06 in early evening
116 bottles, same adults as used to stud Chamber A, allowed to mate and lay eggs for ~ 36 hours
kept in same incubator (8-8 light cycle, 25 C)
flipped adults out (into morgue) on 2019_04_08 in mid-morning
inserted pupal sheets at same time

on 12 April late pm, turned incubator temp down to 22C

plan to transfer sheets on 13 April

actually transferred sheets in late morning on 14 April. Pupal sheet analysis estimated 100K flies, a result of which I'm way suspicious. Though I guess they did have 36 hours to lay eggs?

14 April  ~ 10% eclosing
15 April  ~ 40-50% eclosing
18 April removed pupal sheets and provided clean fabric/paper towel
18 April removed pupal sheets and provided clean fabric/paper towel. looking very dense and low mortality. Some pupae ( < 5% by visual estimate) not eclosed
declared 3-4 days old on 19 April
