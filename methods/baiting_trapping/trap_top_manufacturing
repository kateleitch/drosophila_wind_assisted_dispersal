Array-of-funnels trap-top manufacture
***********************
Materials:
Flat-woven 100% polyester fabric, white: 
	fabric manufacturing tends to be not very stable, but the product I used is "Casa" 100% polyester chiffon, white, Joann Fabric no. 400075440594. Manufactured by Bumirang in Seoul, South Korea
	key features of fabric: 100% polyester, not dyed, fiber strands are ________ microns diameter and the inter-fiber spacing is ______ microns

Procedure:

1) Heat iron (standard clothes iron) to "polyester" setting and iron fabric atop a soft substrate to remove all wrinkles
2) Position two layers of polyester on laser-cutting bed such that the grain is parallel/perpendicular to the laser cutter bed (the important thing is that the funnel "seams"
are at 45 deg to the grain so that the funnels have a symmetrical open shape when turned seam-side-in)
3) Again, in lasercutting bed, iron the two pieces of mesh.
4) Weigh down fabric at edges with aluminum endplates/washers/nuts
5) Focus lasercutter head to the cutting bed (because fabric thickness is negligible)
6) Using colormapping, cut the seams with the following protocol:
    - blue zig-zag seams (to be fused) should be sent as the first cutting job: speed 5% power 2%, freq 5kHz, vector (not raster), air assist off
    - once all blue seams have been fused, evenly soak the fabric with deionized water (using a misting water bottle).
    - then, send all green seams (to be cut, but not to be fused) as the second cutting job: speed 55% power 8%, freq 5kHz, vector (not raster), air assist off
 

7) Carefully remove cut pieces. Some straight seams occasionally do fuse together; these need to be cut with sharp sewing shears to prevent snags in the weave
8) As if using an envelope opener, carefully "unzip" the seams that had been specified with green colormapping; these should not have fused together, but they will be slightly stuck
8) Stitch funnel-strips together, with a straight stitch, with melted seams facing inward. Take care to not sew over the funnels; pins are useful here. Seam allowances are specified by the notches in the lasercut fabric pieces.
9) Once done sewing, trim seam allowances to < 1cm
10) Invert funnels and be sure funnel openings are consistent

Setting up the trap:
*******************
These mesh trap-tops were optimized for 28 x 28 x 17 cm traps (Square Colorwave Smart Store Tote Translucent; Container Store SKU#: 10062800)
With lasercutter, cut out interior of polypropylene lid that comes with the square bucket, leaving just a square "lip" that can be snapped onto the bucket.
	cutting file: ~/Documents/coyote_lake_methods/trap/square_trap_lid.svg
	cutting parameters: speed 10%, power 18%
Add bait to trap (500 mL prepared ferment, plus one opened single-serve container of Gerber banana food)
Secure mesh array-of-funnels to the trap itself by draping it over the trap opening, sandwiching it under the square "lip," and tensioning the lip with the bucket's snaps.
Adjust tension of mesh manually so that funnels are tensed open, but seams aren't stressed. Secure edges with some lab tape.
