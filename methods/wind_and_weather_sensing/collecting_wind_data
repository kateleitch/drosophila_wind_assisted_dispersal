how we have been collecting wind data in the field

Materials
*********
Met One Instruments, Inc. - Model 020C wind direction sensor
Met One Instruments, Inc. - Model 010C wind speed sensor
cable assemblies for powering the two sensors and sending data to acquisition hardware - also from metone

spirit level assembly to ensure anemometer is level with ground (note: this is pretty robust because the vane is counterweighted)
crosspole assembly to mount both sensors
tripod and mounting plate to hold crosspole assembly ~ 4.5 feet off the ground (this height has not been measured or stereotyped)


Data logging in field - two alternate methods
*********************************************
1. to launch logging via Python GUI:
cd ~/src/m1_wind_sensor/software/python/m1_wind_sensor/m1_wind_sensor
workon anemometer
m1_logger -w [width of display window in seconds]

ALTERNATELY

2. to launch logging via web server:
cd ~/src/m1_wind_sensor/software/javascript/m1_wind_sensor_server
node server.js
http://localhost:5000/

IN EITHER CASE
data saved to ~/m1_wind_data in time-stamped .txt file

Data logging parameters
***********************
update rate:
minimum acquisition time prior to fly release: _____ minutes
wind direction oriented with respect to magnetic north
