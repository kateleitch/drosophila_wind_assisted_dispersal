#Wind-assisted dispersal in <i>Drosophila</i>

Data repository (field data and behavioral simulations) for all figures in:
The long distance flight behavior of Drosophila suggests a general model for wind-assisted dispersal in insects

1) DATA FORMATS
This repository contains a mixture of different data formats, all offering reasonable human-readability, and all able to be read into a python environment using only open-source tools. 
	- Almost all 


- json (JavaScript Object Notation, a "lightweight data-interchange format," 
1) PRIMARY SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES
- Python 2.7
- OpenCV ( )


2) IF READERS WANT THE ORIGINAL CAMERA-TRAP DATA, I'LL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE IT, 3) NEED TO PROVIDE A DIGESTIBLE WAY FOR A READER TO UNDERSTAND WHICH PYTHON SCRIPTS WILL ALLOW THEM TO VISUALIZE/RE-ANALYZE WHICH THINGS, 4) WITHOUT PERTURBING DIRECTORY STRUCTURE, WOULD LIKE TO MAKE CLEAR WHICH EXPERIMENT DATES GAVE RISE TO WHICH FIGURES
