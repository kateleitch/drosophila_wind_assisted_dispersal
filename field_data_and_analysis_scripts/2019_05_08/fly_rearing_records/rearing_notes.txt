NOTE: I JUST LEARNED THAT THE 22 HONG INCUBATOR IS ACTUALLY SITTING AT 25 DEGREES! THE TEMPS REPORTED BELOW ARE ACTUAL TEMPS, AS MEASURED BY A DATALOGGER THAT I CROSS-REFERENCED AGAINST OUR 25-DEGREE INCUBATOR.

THIS 3-DEGREE DIFFERENCE EXPLAINS WHY THE LAST RELEASE'S FLIES DEVELOPED SO EXTREMELY QUICKLY (I WAS TRYING TO REAR THEM AT 25 BUT PROBABLY ACTUALLY REARED THEM AROUND 28)

#############################################################################
Chamber A studded 2019_04_21 in early evening
130 bottles, each with ~30 adults
yeast in bottles
moved to Hong lab incubator (8am - 8pm light cycle, 25 C, _____ relative humidity) to mate and lay eggs for ~26 hours
added pupal sheets at the same time of flipping studs into bottles for chamber B (2019_04_22 late evening)

25 April: noticed that the bottles were full of plump, crawling third-instar larvae, which seemed a bit quick...
26 April: nearly 20% of larvae have pupated
26 April mid afternoon: moved all the Chamber A flies up to our 18C incubator to slow them down a bit. Plan is to keep them here until both groups are looking roughly at the same stage
27 April mid afternoon: about 60% pupated, none are dark  [predict that they'll eclose in 4 - 6 days if I keep them at this temp]
28 April mid morning: about 90 - 98% pupated, none are dark
29 April mid morning: about 100% pupated, about 1% dark
30 April mid morning: about 100% pupated, about 3% dark
01 May mid morning: about 100% pupated, about 15% dark, maybe 0.5% eclosing?
01 May late afternoon: transferred all 130 sheets to release chamber, and left at room temp (23.5 C) 

DOBs, estimated by eye: 01 May (1%), 03 May (50%), 04 May (final 50%)
Age ranges at day-of-release (08 May): 5 - 6 days old

Chamber B studded 2019_04_22 in late evening 
130 bottles, each with ~30 adults
yeast in bottles
moved to Hong lab incubator (8am - 8pm light cycle, 25 C, _____ relative humidity) to mate and lay eggs for _____ hours

2019_04_23 late evening flipped out studs and inserted pupal sheets

26 April: still very few larvae have reached third-instar, which indicates to me that they are well more than 24 hours behind Chamber A.
27 April mid afternoon: many larvae are plump, third-instar, crawling on transfer sheets. A small fraction (maybe 1%?) have pupated [predict that they'll eclose in 4 -6 days if I keep them at this temp]
28 April mid morning: about 40% pupated, none are dark
29 April late morning: about 50 - 60% pupated, about 1% dark
30 April mid morning: about 80% pupated, about 1% dark
01 May mid morning: about 90% pupated, 30% of which are dark, about 2-5% eclosing (yikes)
01 May mid afternoon: removed from Betty's incubator and brought upstairs to our lab. poured 4L of sucrose agar into fly-kitchen-cleaned release chamber and started transferring sheets. I started getting really uncomfortable with the number of not-pupated larvae, so after transferring 30 pupal sheets, I paused, leaving all these flies at room temp (23.5 C). Resumed transferring final 100 sheets around midnight on 01 May

DOBs, estimated by eye: 01 May (5%), 02 May (30%), 03 May (40%), 04 May (final 30%)
Age ranges at day-of-release (08 May): 5 - 7 days old

notes on release timing, and other rearing notes:

as of 27 April, I think both batches will be eclosing on 01 - 03 May. If I want to release 3-6 day-old flies, that means a release date of ~05-08 May
as of 27 April, I think I'll transfer the pupal sheets for both chambers on Monday, 29 April
as of 29 April, I think I'll transfer the pupal sheets on Tuesday, 30 April
as of 30 April, I think I could get away with transferring the sheets one day later (Wednesday, 01 May, in the early am). To me, later seems better. Risk of some eclosing in bottle, which is inconvenient, but I suspect the less time they spend in the release chamber, the healthier they'll be come release-day? 

01 May mid morning, made 4L of sucrose agar (see recipe in coyote_lake_methods/husbandry/rearing) for EACH chamber (twice the volume as in previous field releases, to see if that protects against drying out)
