## The data

If you would like to re-run our analyses starting from our raw camera-trap image stream, please contact the authors (leitchka@gmail.com). Camera data from each experiment comprise 30 to 120 GB of data; we will make available, upon reasonable request, these data from individual experiments or from the entire dataset (~0.5 TB).

Once you have the data, you will need to follow the following instructions for making the data accessible to the analysis (below).
